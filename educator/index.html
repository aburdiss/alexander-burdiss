          I have played the trombone since I was 11, and have been playing solos
          since I was 15. I have devoted most of my life to learning the craft,
          and have loved every second of it. When I make music, I want my
          audiences to be able to connect with the music. I want to make complex
          musical pieces more accessible to all, and to bring live music back
          into the world of the common man, because I believe that a lot of
          modern music has become less about the music, and more about
          accompanying the lyrics that go with it, or has become so intellectual
          that if the listener cannot understand what is happening if they are
          not a musician. It is my aim to try to play music so full of energy,
          and in a way that will enhance the lives of every audience member I
          play for.

          I believe that being honest in what I do as a musician is the most
          valuable asset that I can possess. Playing in a way that only I can
          play makes me stand out from the crowd, and allows me to speak with my
          true voice. In my past, I have played too many shows where I am
          concentrated solely on the notes coming out, and I feel I have been
          unprepared in my earlier shows. The first time I actually felt
          prepared for a show was for a recital in college. I stepped out
          onstage with my music memorized (I felt over-prepared at the time) and
          I just tried to play something the audience would enjoy instead of
          trying to play all the notes right. By doing so I have found a way to
          play more expressively, be more true to myself, and ultimately play
          better than I ever have before.
